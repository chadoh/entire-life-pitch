Value Proposition & Target Demographic
--------------------------------------

**Beautiful digital scrapbooking with privacy & business model that's right for your family** for **28-40 year-old parents**.


Without Further Ado
-------------------

Facebook has become the way that parents share photos of their children with loved ones. It has its benefits, but many parents now feel that they're _performing_ parenthood. Rather than focusing on the moments that mean the most to us, social media biases us toward sharing only those moments we suspect will get the most Likes. And once those Facebook-Likeable moments fade from the algorithm after about 18 hours, they're hard to reflect on until Facebook wraps them up into a Memory, but even then, this doesn't give parents the sort of birds-eye view they desire for their family's story. Combine this with growing concerns about privacy, and just who has access to photos of our children and how those photos are being used, and it's easy to understand why a growing number of parents are choosing to avoid posting photos of their children on Facebook altogether.

Let me introduce Entire.Life: an app that you can use on your phone, laptop, or tablet designed to lift you as far as possible above the noise of social media and other apps. Rather than showing you everyone else's highlights (or politics), or even your own busy schedule, Entire.Life shows you the whole thing. Your whole life. Birth-to-death, and the story in between: a row for each year of your life, and a dot or image for each week. From this zoomed-out perspective, you can time-travel backward for reflection and gratitude, or time-travel forward to dream and set intentions.

Over the past two and a half years, with my cofounder and I working on Entire.Life as a hobby in our freetime, with minimal resources applied, we've enjoyed steady growth, with about 1% of our customers liking the free version so much that they purchase one of our paid upgrades, such as the Instagram add-on, which imports your cluttered photo history into our spacious interface. Our power-users love the weekly email we send, which reminds you to pause and reflect on what was important to you this week, not just what will score well on social media.

These current customers love Entire.Life for what it is, and now we're ready to evolve it into something more. Not just high-level milestone journaling to help individuals live a more meaningful life, but also beautiful digital scrapbooking, with the privacy and business model that's right for your whole family. We'll show you every week of your and your family's past, and every hopeful week of your shared future.

In addition to the web interface, we'll soon have a text-message interface, with customizable reminders to record moments before they slip away into the noise of your camera role. And we'll send you wrap-ups about key moments in your family's journey, such as birthdays and anniversaries. You'll be able to order well-designed physical keepsakes commemorating these milestones, such as photo books and collages.

There are a growing number of apps in this space, but none of them combine all the elements of Entire.Life, let alone doing it so beautifully.

My background in full-stack software engineering plus my cofounder's background in digital strategy plus our shared enthusiasm for humane tech and meaningful living make us a great team to bring Entire.Life to the world.

We estimate it will take three months of runway to adapt Entire.Life to this new target market of 28-40 year-old parents. From there, our market research confirms that we can switch to a new payment model, charging a flat $8/mo or $40/yr for all premium features. With smart marketing, as a low-end estimate, we believe we can attract 100 paid users in our first month, with 100% growth for the first few months plateauing to 30% growth thereafter. These conservative estimates get us 170 thousand dollars of income by the end of the first year, and four million by the end of year two.

We want get started with bringing Entire.Life to this eager new market, but it's hard with only our evenings and weekends. That's where you come in. When can we meet to talk about growing Entire.Life?
