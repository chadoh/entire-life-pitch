Value Proposition & Target Demographic
--------------------------------------

**A quiet invitation to reflection, gratitude, & milestone journaling** for **techie 20-to-30-somethings who want to live more meaningfully**.


Without Further Ado
-------------------

Phones everywhere are buzzing with notifications sucking you into apps designed to keep you lost in other people's revelry and your own slog. Seeking refuge from the noise of our information space, many forward-thinking tech-minded people are looking backwards: technology fasts; app deletion; paper journals. This demographic isn't anti-technology, but they want humane technology. They want to live more meaningfully, and if an app actually has their best interests in mind, they're happy to use it. As evidence of this trend, may I present the rising popularity of meditation apps, life-documentation apps, fitness trackers, mood trackers, happiness trackers.

We've created an app that you can use on your phone, laptop, or tablet that lifts you as far as possible above your slog; rather than just showing you what's now and what's next, we show you the whole thing. Your whole life. Birth to death, and the story in between. We call it Entire.Life. 

Entire.Life shows you a grid displaying every week of your past and every hopeful week of your future, arranged into a 52-wide by 100-tall grid. You can click on a week to see details about it, add memories and plans for that week, and augment your chart with add-ons and integrations, such as a paid Instagram add-on which imports your photo history into our friendly interface. 

You can try Entire.Life now. The web address is easy to remember; it's the same as the name. www.entire.life

Entire.Life is a refuge from the noise of other apps. A place for reflection, intention-setting, gratitude, and planning. An app to complement and augment those other practices you've been developingâ€”meditation, journaling, information detox. Or if you haven't cultivated those practices yet, it's a non-judgmental app that's easy to use that will still inspire you to live into a better story.

Most of our current 2000 users are techie and tech-adjacent 20-&-30-somethings from around the world. We're currently working to understand our audience better, having conversations with active users and developing complementary product offerings such as life-improvement workbooks and e-courses to serve and interact with our most enthusiastic supporters more deeply. Once we've dialed in our target demographic, we plan to change our pricing model from an annually-billed, a-la-carte freemium model to a monthly-billed, single-tier model. We believe our core audience will happily pay $5/month for their most-wanted features and the promise of sustainable app improvement.

The life-in-weeks life chart idea was created by the blog Wait But Why in 2014. This blog makes an obvious key partner for us. If 1% of its 600,000 email subscribers become paying Entire.Life users, that brings in $360k per year for Entire.Life. There are many other key partnerships we can pursue, such as prominent Bullet Journalling YouTubers, who have more than 1M followers and easily get more than 400k views on their videos.

Beyond our core audience, other enthusiastic markets await our ability to tailor the app to their needs. One prominent use of Entire.Life will be digital scrapbooking for families: an alternative to posting your children's photos on Facebook where privacy policies intentionally confuse and advertisers build profiles on your children from the time they're in-utero.

There are no real competitors in this space. Some apps, services, and YouTube channels are complementary to our mission, and the few apps that compete directly aren't really trying to make money.

My background in full-stack software engineering plus my cofounder's background in digital strategy plus our shared enthusiasm for humane technology and meaningful living make us a great team to bring this app to the world.

To get where we're going, we need six months of runway. That's where you come in. When can we meet for a longer conversation?
