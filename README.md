Explanation of Two-Minute Pitch
-------------------------------

Two minute verbal pitch. Here are some of the things that should be included in your pitch:

- Clearly introduce the problem/need
- Introduce your product/service
- Answer the question - why will these customers buy your product/service?
- Identify the market (market demographics, size, etc.)
- Are there any competitors?  Why are you better?
- Describe some very simple financial projections
- What are your 6 month to 1 year very rough execution plans?
- How much money are you asking from this investor?
- Who are the team members that will make this happen and what are their credentials?


Value Proposition & Target Demographic
--------------------------------------

**Beautiful digital scrapbooking with privacy & business model that's right for your family** for **28-40 year-old parents**.


Without Further Ado
-------------------

Facebook has become the way that parents share photos of their children with loved ones. It has its benefits, but many parents now feel that they're _performing_ parenthood. Rather than record the moments that mean the most to us, social media biases us to share only what we think will get the most Likes. Add to this the near-sighted clutter of social media, mounting privacy concerns, and it's easy to understand why more & more parents avoid posting photos of our children on Facebook altogether.

Let me introduce Entire.Life: an app you can use on any device, designed to lift you as far as possible above that near-sighted clutter and show you your entire life. Birth-to-death, and the story in between: a row for each year, and a dot or image for each week. From this bird's-eye view, you can time-travel back for reflection and gratitude, or time-travel ahead to dream and set intentions.

Life moves fast. The persistent pulsing of the present; the nonstop nagging of Now and Next—it's easy to get lost. It's easy for all these precious points to pass without poignancy; to lose ourselves in an endless mess of rootless todo lists and other people's revelry. Your slog is beautiful. In context. Your slog is beautiful! Entire.Life gives you the perspective to perceive it. Entire.Life gives you the clearance for clarity.

Over the past two years, with my cofounder and I working in our freetime with minimal budget, Entire.Life has still enjoyed steady growth, with about 1% of customers liking the free version so much they purchase a paid upgrade. Now we're ready to make it something more. Not just high-level journaling to help you live more meaningfully, but also beautiful digital scrapbooking for your whole family.

There are a growing number of apps in this space. At one end of the spectrum are Google Photos and iCloud Photos; apps where all ten photos you took of your latté until you got one that was good enough all clutter your camera role, and the meaning gets choked out by noise. And yes, there's Facebook, with frustrations I mentioned formerly. And then there's a growing field of more direct competitors; apps focused on private photo sharing and keepsake creation for families. None of these have the meditatively spacious interface of Entire.Life, and none have Entire.Life's dual focus on adult self-actualization and familial fulfillment.

It will take one year to adapt Entire.Life for this eager new market. From there, we'll switch our payment model, charging a flat $40/yr for all premium features, depending on what the market can bear. With smart marketing driven by targeted podcast advertising, workshop and conference placements, and blogger affiliates, we'll aim for 100 paid users in the next month. Our low-end projections show us at 170 thousand in revenue a year later, and four million dollars by year two, with a total serviceable market of about $110 million, as a conservative estimate.

My background in full-stack software engineering plus my cofounder's background in digital strategy make us a great team to bring Entire.Life to the world. We want to get started, but it's hard with only our evenings and weekends. That's where you come in. When can we meet to talk about growing Entire.Life?
