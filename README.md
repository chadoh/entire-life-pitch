Value Proposition & Target Demographic
--------------------------------------

**Beautiful digital scrapbooking with privacy & business model that's right for your family** for **28-40 year-old parents**.


Without Further Ado
-------------------

Facebook has become the way that parents share photos of their children with loved ones. It has its benefits, but many parents now feel that they're _performing_ parenthood. Rather than focusing on the moments that mean the most to us, social media biases us to share only what we suspect will get the most Likes. Add to this the near-sighted clutter of social media, mounting privacy concerns, and it's easy to understand why more & more parents avoid posting photos of our children on Facebook altogether.

Let me introduce Entire.Life: an app you can use on any device, designed to lift you as far as possible above that near-sighted clutter and show you your entire life. Birth-to-death, and the story in between: a row for each year, and a dot or image for each week. From this bird's-eye view, you can time-travel back for reflection and gratitude, or time-travel ahead to dream and set intentions.  {{ Talk a little more about the integrations, the birds-eye view, etc }}

Over the past two years, with my cofounder and I working in our freetime with minimal budget, Entire.Life has still enjoyed steady growth, with about 1% of customers liking the free version so much they purchase a paid upgrade. Now we're ready to make it something more. Not just high-level journaling to help you live more meaningfully, but also beautiful digital scrapbooking for your whole family.

There are a growing number of apps in this space, but none of them combine all the elements of Entire.Life.  {{ What are the one or two things that truly make Entire.Life different than the other solutions out there? }}

My background in full-stack software engineering plus my cofounder's background in digital strategy make us a great team to bring Entire.Life to the world.

It will take three months to adapt Entire.Life for this eager new market. From there, we'll switch our payment model, charging a flat $40/yr for all premium features. With smart marketing, we'll attract 100 paid users in the next month. Our low-end projections show us at 170 thousand in revenue a year later, and four million dollars by year two.  {{ Can you incorporate some ideas of what marketing channels you will use?  What aboiut partnerships with https://www.creativememories.com or https://www.daytimer.com or https://shop.franklinplanner.com/store since these are companies that help folks look at the bigger picture of life }}

We want get started with this, but it's hard with only our evenings and weekends. That's where you come in. We are looking for an investment of $200,000.  This will help fund us for one year and will allow us to:
  - develop our beta version of Entire.Life
  - develop and fund our 1 year marketing plan
  - hire a product manager
  
When can we meet to talk about growing Entire.Life?
