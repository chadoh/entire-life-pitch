Without Further Ado
-------------------

Facebook has become the way that parents share photos of their children with grandparents, aunts & uncles, and close family friends. It has its benefits, but so many parents now feel that they're _performing_ parenthood. Rather than focusing on the moments that mean the most to them, social media biases parents toward sharing only those moments they suspect will get the most Likes. And once those Facebook-Likeable moments fade from the algorithm after about 18 hours, they're hard to reflect on until Facebook wraps them up into a Memory, but even then, this doesn't give parents the sort of birds-eye view they desire for their family's story. Combine this with growing concerns about privacy, and just who has access to photos of their children and how those photos are being used, and it's easy to understand why a growing number of parents are choosing to avoid posting photos of their children on Facebook altogether.

We've created an app that you can use on your phone, laptop, or tablet that gives you a bird's-eye of your individual life. Rather than showing you just the noise of what everyone's doing right now, or even just showing you your own busy schedule, we show you the whole thing. Your whole life. Birth to death, and the story in between. Now we're extending Entire.Life to work for your whole family; beautiful, digital scrapbooking with the privacy and business model that makes sense for you.

Entire.Life shows you a grid displaying every week of your—and your child's—past and every hopeful week of your shared future, arranged into a 52-wide by 100-tall grid. You can click on a week to see details about it, add memories and plans for that week, and augment your chart with add-ons and integrations, such as an Instagram add-on which imports your photo history into our friendly interface.

You can try Entire.Life now. The web address is easy to remember; it's the same as the name. www.entire.life

Entire.Life is a refuge from the noise of other apps. A place for reflection, intention-setting, and gratitude. We send you an email once a week, inviting you to reflect on the moments that were meaningful for you—not just what will score well on social media. And soon, we'll have a text-message interface that prompts you weekly or daily—however often you want—to record the little things that slip away so quickly.

Entire.Life will also send you wrap-ups, commemorating key moments in your family's journey, such as birthdays. We will offer the ability to create well-designed physical keepsakes, such as books and collages.

There are a growing number of apps that solve this in creative ways—text message baby journaling, private photo sharing for the whole extended family—but none of them combine all five of the elements of Entire.Life:

1. Regular reminders to record memories, so moments don't fall into the overwhelm of your camera role
2. Ease of recording what's important, separate from the noise of social media
3. Gathering a birds-eye view of your family's life
4. A privacy & advertising model that's family-friendly
5. Beautiful physical keepsakes

My background in full-stack software engineering plus my cofounder's background in digital strategy plus our shared enthusiasm for humane technology and meaningful living make us a great team to bring this app to the world.

Entire.Life is currently targeted toward the individuals. To adapt it to the family market, I need three months of runway to evolve the app in that direction. That's where you come in. When can we meet for a longer conversation?
